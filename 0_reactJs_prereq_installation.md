# Install node / yarn

    How to Download & Install Node.js
    First of all, you are going to need NPM (or Yarn, alternatively). Let's use NPM for this example.
 
## node js official website
 https://nodejs.org/en/
 
### After you download and install Node, start your terminal/command prompt and run node -v and npm -v to see which versions you have.

    Your version of NPM should be at least 5.2.0 or newer because create-react-app requires that we have NPX installed. 
    If you have an older version of NPM, run this command to update it:
    
  
## How to Install Create-React-App
    npx create-react-app my-app

    cd my-app
    
    npm start
    
 
## How To Install and Use the Yarn Package Manager for Node.js
  https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-the-yarn-package-manager-for-node-js
  
        Yarn is a package manager for Node.js that focuses on speed, security, and consistency.
        It was originally created to address some issues with the popular NPM package manager. 
        Though the two package managers have since converged in terms of performance and features, Yarn remains popular, especially in the world of React development.
        
        ### Some of the unique features of Yarn are:

              A per-project caching mechanism, that can greatly speed up subsequent installs and builds
              Consistent, deterministic installs that guarantee the structure of installed libraries are always the same
              Checksum testing of all packages to verify their integrity
              “Workspaces”, which facilitate using Yarn in a monorepo (multiple projects developed in a single source code repository)


### Prerequisites
      Before installing and using the Yarn package manager, you will need to have Node.js installed. 
      To see if you already have Node.js installed, type the following command into your local command line terminal:
